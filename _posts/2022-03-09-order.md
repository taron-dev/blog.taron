# Order necessary devices and facilities

I decided to buy following devices and facilites: Raspberry Pi, charger, SD card, box, board, SSD disk, fan.

Order: ![packed order]({{ '/assets/images/packed_order.jpg' | relative_url }})

Unpacked order: ![unpacked order]({{ '/assets/images/unpacked_order.jpg' | relative_url }})

You will need:
1. Raspberry Pi computer (recommended at least 2GB). I bought one from [rpishop.cz](https://rpishop.cz/raspberry-pi-4b/1599-raspberry-pi-4-model-b-2gb-ram-765756931175.html).
2. Charger. I bought official charger [rpishop.cz](https://rpishop.cz/zdroje/1595-OFI045.html).
3. Metal case for the Raspberry, disk and fan `Geekworm X825-C8 (X825 V2.0)`. I bought it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09295FHBW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
4. Expansion board `Geekworm Raspberry Pi 4 SATA X825 V2.0`. It serves to connect disk with Raspberry and on/of button on metal case. I bought it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B091JSRQ9C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
5. Power management and cooling fan `Geekworm Raspberry Pi 4 X735 V2.5`. I bought it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07NLR49L1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
6. 2,5" SATA disk of your preference. It will be connected to expansion board. I chose 480GB SSD.
7. Micro SD card. You'll need one to write your Raspberry Pi image.
