# Box installation

> Prerequisites
- [Order devices and facilities](../order/)

Prepare all items from the order: charger, box, fan, board, ssd and Raspberry Pi like we can see in the following image.
![order](/assets/images/unpacked_order.jpg)

For the first steps we will need board, ssd, screws and Raspberry Pi. Other things we could put aside.

As the first step we will connect the X825 board with ssd.

Insert the ssd to the sata port on the bottom side of the X825 board and use two screws to fix the ssd from the top of the X825 board. The following image shows the mounted ssd to X825 board form the bottom.

Use anoter four screws to fix the Raspberry Pi on top of the X825 board like in the two following photo if you want to play a bit with just this setup. If not just put the Raspberry Pi on top of the board.

Prepare fan, screws and spacer nuts.

Use spacer nuts to fix the Raspberry Pi and make space for placing fan on top the spacer nuts. Don't forget to fix the fan with spacer nuts. Result should be similar to following photo.

It's time to open the box. We will find, like in the following picture, the small fan, which we will not need and the button to turn on, off, or restart the device.

Place carefully our setup into to box and fix it with screws from the bottom.

Do not forget to install the button to be able to control the device. For this I recommend to check the installation video from manofacturer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxUNhIxXgj4 or more detailed one from DB Tech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh1_05AZmzI.

Cover the setup with lid and fix the box with screws. Do not forget to connect X825 board with the Raspberry Pi via USB interconnector.

We could check the final setup on the following photos.
